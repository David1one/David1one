### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David McMahon. I'm a physics undergraduate, and I code quite heavily as part of that, primarily with Python.

I'm currently a member of the Photonics Integration team at the Tyndall National Institute - please check them out.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Raspberry Pi, and I'm hoping to have enough experience to help mentor the ninjas at Coderdojo Bishopstown once we reopen. I'm open to any projects suggestions I could bring them through to introduce the machine to them.
